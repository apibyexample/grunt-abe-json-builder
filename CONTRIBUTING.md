## Contributing

We at API By Example, encourage anyone to contribute to any of our repositories.

### Code Styles

Please see https://github.com/rockabox/rb-js-linter for JS Style information.

### Pull requests

If you fixed or added something useful to the project, you can send a pull request.
It will be reviewed by maintainer and accepted, or commented for rework, or declined.

### Bugs

If you found an error, typo or any other flaw in the project, please report about
it using GitHub Issues. The more details you provide, the easier it could be
reproduced and the faster it could be fixed. Unfortunately, sometimes the bug
can only be reproduced in your project or in your environment, so maintainers
cannot reproduce it. In this case we believe you can fix the bug and send us the
fix.

### Features

If you've got an idea about a new feature, it's most likely that you'll have to
implement it on your own. If you cannot implement the feature, but it is very
important, you can create an issue at GitHub, but expect it to be declined by
the maintainer.
